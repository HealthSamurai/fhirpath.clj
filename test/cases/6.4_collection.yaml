# Merge the two collections into a single collection, eliminating any duplicate values (using equals (=)) to determine equality). Unioning an empty collection to a non-empty collection will return the non-empty collection with duplicates eliminated. There is no expectation of order in the resulting collection.

# If the left operand is a collection with a single item, this operator returns true if the item is in the right operand using equality semantics. If the left-hand side of the operator is the empty collection is empty, the result is empty, if the right-hand side is empty, the result is false. If the left operand has multiple items, an exception is thrown.
